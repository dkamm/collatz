## Collatz Tree
This is a repo of my toying with the Collatz problem. For the writeup, see [collatz_tree.ipynb](https://github.com/dkamm/collatz/blob/master/collatz_tree.ipynb)

There are 2 code files.

- collatz.py consists of generic math functions and some Collatz problem specific ones
- tree.py consists of functions specific to generating and visualizing the tree in html
